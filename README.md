# GardenHero3.0

## GardenHero3.0 whats that?
The GardenHero will be the Hero to save Plants and Flowers which will be forgotten frequently. 
The GardenHero3.0 is watering the plants if they need water. Thats it... But the Idea has more potential!
The project is currently planned to water the plants in my room but in the future this prototype could be an instrument not only to water plants
but also to monitor the growing state and other statics of the plant.

This repository will be extended over the next weeks.
There will come more information and code ;-)

Stay tuned, it will be hot!
